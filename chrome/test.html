    <h1>Test Page for Music Context Protocol</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Working on a Programming Project</h2>
        <p>I'm currently debugging a Chrome extension that automatically plays music based on the context of what you're working on. This involves analyzing web page content and using AI to understand the work context.</p>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>The extension uses content scripts to extract meaningful text from web pages, then sends this to a background script that processes it with Google Gemini AI to determine if the context has changed significantly.</p>
            
            <p>When a context change is detected, it queries a music recommendation API to get appropriate tracks based on the current work context. It's designed to help people focus by automatically providing suitable background music.</p>
        </div>

        <p>If you can see this page content being extracted in the extension popup, then the content script is working correctly!</p>
